Steppers
-----------------------------------------------
                   

- Steppers are used to guide users through a sequential series of steps to complete a task like registration. 

- Don't nest steppers, as in a stepper within a stepper. 

- Linear stepper requires the steps to be completed in a specific order. 

- A nonlinear stepper allows a user to bounce back and forth between steps.
